Now let me just make a resume of what we just learned:
- Variable - A piece of code that can hold anything from a couple of characters to gigantic numbers
- String - Strings are variables that hold text. To tell the program that some set of characters is a string we surround the text with quotes "".
- Function- A piece of machine code that is focused on doing a specific task.Functions can be reused in multiple times through out your code.
- The print function - The print functions outputs whatever is inside of its brackets to the console. Example:
print("Hello!")

Would print "Hello!" to the console. 
- backdoor symbol (\) - Its a custom symbol that "escapes" certain characters that usually do something for the string. For example it can be used to print the quotation marks that usually end the string. If you put a backdoor symbol before one of those other characters it will treat it as "text" not as anything custom. For example:
print("\"Hello\"")

Would print "Hello" in quotes to the console itself. Backdoor characters can also be used in custom combinations. 
- Custom combinations - They are a combination of a backdoor symbol and a character. Most of them ill be covering when we need to use them. 
- Newline - (\n)  - The newline custom combination is the backslash symbol plus n. It tells the string that this in a newline inside of the string. For example if you wanted to print "Hello" and "Who are you" in the same string in different lines you would do:
print("Hello\nWho are you")


Thats basically it for now but i will cover other functions later today or in a couple of days. For now what i want you to do is push this to its max. Make your own text art with it in the console or write a cool story. Be creative and do something that is both fun and exciting.
